# Concentration-nation
An exercise in writing a simple concentration game in as many programming languages as I could manage.

When I was in college I wrote a concentration game in Visual Basic 6 for a class assignment (and stored it on a 3 1/2 
inch floppy disk).

Years later, when I had some free time, I tried to recreate the application in **Java**. In my professional career I am most
familiar with **C#** so I did a version in that programming language next. Then **VB.NET**.

I hadn't done any **C++** since college so I tackled that version next. Then I tried a couple of versions that are not on the
upper end of the popularity scale programming language wise (**F#** and **TCL**).

I decided it was time to re-do the **VB6** version since, by now, the 3 1/2 inch floppy was no good to me. Next I did a **Python** 
version because it seems to be a popular programming language at the moment.

Lastly, I created a **Javascript/jQuery** version so I could have something to put on a web page. It's a stripped down version
compared to most of the rest.

**_NOTE:_** None of the image files used for any of the games have been uploaded with the exception of the Javascript example.
I did leave the _images_ folder as a place holder. Each game requires at least 8 images. For most of the games I used 48 or 49 
images. The Javascript example only uses 8 images (a subset of the what I used for a couple of the other games).
